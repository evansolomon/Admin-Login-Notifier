## Admin Login Notifier

Notify a site administrator when someone tries to login to the site as "admin" (the username).  The plugin saves the password the would-be login tried to use, which allows the site administrator to make fun of bots.  Attempted passwords can be seen in the WordPress dashboard and will be emailed to a site admin once per day.
